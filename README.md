CunRoutes is a simple app to visualise the different bus routes in the city of Cancun. 
Each Route has a color and name/number (you can find this last two usually in the front of every bus in the city)
The user can select to see all routes or just the ones that it needs.
Finally the user can create a custom route and see which bus routes are near.

> *** Please Notice that this is custom work and free work, this is NOT an official Bus Route app of any company or the government.

> This was created to help, for this reason the state of future updates is unknown.*
